# Survey Tool - Ruby

Welcome to the Ruby starter kit for the survey tool exercise!

Included here is a simple CLI executable, a `lib/cli.rb` to hold the beginnings of your
application logic, plus an RSpec installation and a single failing integration test, which
should help you drive the beginning of your implementation.

## Development

`ruby 3.2.2` is required as per `Gemfile` spec

Refer `Makefile` for installation and usage instructions => in terminal just run `make` to see all available commands

```sh
$ make
